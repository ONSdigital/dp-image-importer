# dp-image-importer

ONS service that imports uploaded images and adds them to a private bucket

## Getting started

* Run `make debug`

The service runs in the background consuming messages from Kafka. The messages are produced by the
[image API](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-image-api) and an example image can be created using the helper script,
`make produce`.

### Dependencies

* Requires running…
  * [kafka & kafka](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/master/guides/INSTALLING.md#prerequisites)
  * [zebedee](https://github.com/ONSdigital/zebedee)
  * [dp-image-api](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-image-api)
  * [AWS S3 access](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/master/guides/AWS_CREDENTIALS.md)
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`

### Healthcheck

 The `/health` endpoint returns the current status of the service. Dependent services are health checked on an interval defined by the `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL` environment variable.

 On a development machine a request to the health check endpoint can be made by:

 `curl localhost:24800/health`
